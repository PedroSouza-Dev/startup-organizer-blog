# Startup organizer Blog

## As a part of exercises from book "Django Unleashed" from Andrew Pinkham

### Description:

"Given the approachable nature of a blog, we will build a blog with special features. A
blog is a list of articles, or blog posts, published on a single site and organized by date. Blog
authors may choose to write about anything in each post, but they usually stick to a general
theme throughout the entire blog. Our blog focuses on news relating to technology startup
businesses. The goal is to help publicize startups to blog readers.

The problem with most blogs is that their topics are not well organized. Blogging
platforms typically label blog posts with tags, leading writers to create tags for each item they
blog about. A blog about startups would likely have a tag for each startup written about. We
use Django to improve our blogâ€™s topic organization.

In our website, we expand blog functionality by codifying the creation of startups. Each
startup will be its own object, not a tag. The advantage of making startups their own objects
is that it allows us to add special information about them. We can now display information
related to the business. We can list a description and a date, and we can even link to external
articles written about the startup. These capabilities would not be possible if the startup were
simply a tag."
